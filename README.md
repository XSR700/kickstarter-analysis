### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

During the process of obtaining and working on the data, I went through 3 challenges that I had to overcome. 

While I was familliar with using Excel, my first challenge was downloading the software on my personal laptop. I have always used Excel on my work computer and needed to subcribe new license for my own. Thankfully Excel provies a 1 month free trial for all registered users. After I signed up for the free trial and downloaded Excel, Microsoft denied access because my email was not "associated" with the registered account. It took me a few moments to google and understand what the issue was. Apperently I had another long forgotten Hotmail account that my Excel connected to. My past automatic log ins seems to have helped link the account. I quickly learned in order to link the Excel to the correct account I had to go to File > Account > Manage Account to log out and sign in with the new account. 



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
