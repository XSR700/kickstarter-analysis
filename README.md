# Kickstarting with Excel
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

## Overview of Project
This report visulizes the data of theater plays that have started crowdfunded campaigns across the world through Kickstarter. The visulation and calculation has been made using Excel Office 16 spreadsheets. Using the Kickstarter data, this project visulies campaign outcomes based on thier launch dates and funding goals. 

### Purpose
Louise is looking for an appropriate budget for her new play called "Fever". The purpose is to present Louise an illustration and discription of past crowdfunded plays, and give a conclusion from the findings to help her estimate a budget. 

## Analysis and Challenges


I aquired the data of 4113 past and present crowdfunded projects from Kickstarter. The data consists collumns     




### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Examining the "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" chart below we can conclude which month is best to start a campaign. The chart displays the outcome of successful, failed, and canceled theater plays from January to December. The successful line spikes during May which means this month had the most successful campaings. Out of the grand total 111 campaigns were sucessfful (67%). However the grand total in May was the highest with 166 total campaigns. This also means that we are more likely to see more campaings being created during this month. More of other campaigns could lead to more competition for Louise. 

Another point to note that the failed orange line stays roughly the same with May, June, July, and August at almost the same outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Looking at the "Outcomes Based on Goal" we can come up with an understanding of which funding goal to choose for our campaign. The chart displays percentage of outcomes of theater plays based on thier choosen goals within the given ranges. We notice that as the goal increases the campaign success rate decreases, however not consistently. After $25000 the Sum of Percentage Successful line starts to increase again and drastically come back down after $40000. With these huge up and down swings could suggest that has not been much data within those ranges. Its better to have a bigger sample pool to use for our analysis. Therefore after we could say $15000 goal the odds of failure starts to increase.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

During the process of obtaining and working on the data, I went through 2 challenges and issues that I had to overcome. 

While I was familliar with using Excel, my first challenge was downloading the software on my personal laptop. I have always used Excel on my work computer and needed to subcribe new license for my own. Thankfully Excel provies a 1 month free trial for all registered users. After I signed up for the free trial and downloaded Excel, Microsoft denied access because my email was not "associated" with the registered account. It took me a few moments to google and understand what the issue was. Apperently I had another long forgotten Hotmail account that my Excel connected to. My past automatic log ins seemed to have helped link the account. I quickly learned in order to link the Excel to the correct account I had to go to File > Account > Manage Account to log out and sign in with the new account.

As I was working through the module, I came across an issue displaying my charts. In module 1.3.3 "Timing Success" the instuctions show how to create a pivot table with a chart to show theater outcomes for each month. I followed the instructions carefully and created my pivot table. My results matched exactly and everything worked fine. However when I pressed _PivotChart_ under _PivotChart Analyze_ the chart did not show up and nothing happend no matter how many times I clicked. I tried restarting Excel and even using a different computer, but nothing happend again. I reached out to one of the TAs and asked for help. The TA said that Excel doesnt know which data to represent and I should restart my Excel file from scratch. I still dont undstand what exactly went wrong in my original work, but I went ahead and restarted my work. I recreated all the new collumns and formulas, and tried creating the chart again. This time it worked and the results matched the findings in the module.  



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Louise should consider making her goal less than $15000. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
